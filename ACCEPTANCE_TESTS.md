## Release standard
A phase is done only when the public, no-login production product passes the full release gate with credible outputs. Building, compiling, localhost success, or a progress report does not count.

- Original regression case.

Record for each run:
- HTTP status.
- Provider attempted.
- Provider that succeeded.

- Cache status.
- Error category.

Failure behavior:
